# Project 1 - *Scavenger Hunt*

Submitted by: **Lou Salvant - Z23637852**

**Scavenger Hunt** is an app designed to engage users in completing a series of photo-based tasks. Each task in the app has a specific prompt that encourages the user to take a photo that fulfills the task's requirement. The core functionality of the app revolves around attaching photos to these tasks and using location data to show where the photo was taken.

## Notes

While adding the camera feature to the Scavenger Hunt app, I faced challenges in extracting GPS data from camera photos, unlike library photos that have embedded metadata. To solve this, I used Core Location for accurate coordinates and deployed the app on a physical device to test the functionality. Managing user permissions for camera and location access and configuring privacy settings in the appâ€™s Info.plist were also key steps.
